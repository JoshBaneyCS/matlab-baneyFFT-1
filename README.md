BaneyFFT- A matlab demonstration of the Fast Fourier Transform in use

Baney Matlab-FFT Project

Overview
This project is a self-learning endeavor in MATLAB undertaken by Joshua Baney, a Computer Science & Electrical Engineering student. The project involves recording audio from a microphone device and performing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using MATLAB's built-in functions. The goal is to generate two types of graphs for analysis: frequency versus magnitude and frequency versus time.

Requirements
MATLAB environment
Microphone device
MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox
Installation
No installation is required other than having MATLAB installed on your system.

Usage
Run the MATLAB script provided.
Follow the on-screen prompts to start speaking for recording 1 and recording 2.
After the recordings are completed, the script will display and compare the FFT results between the two recordings.
Description
The project initializes audio input settings such as sampling frequency and duration of recording.
Two recordings are made from the microphone device.
FFT is performed separately for each recording to analyze frequency components.
The script plots graphs to visualize the frequency versus magnitude and frequency versus time for each recording.
Additionally, a comparison is made by combining the audio data from both recordings and plotting the FFT results.
